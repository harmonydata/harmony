## Description

Please include a summary of the change and which issue is fixed. Please also include relevant context. List any dependencies that are required for this change. Ideally we avoid introducing any new third party dependencies in `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` unless absolutely necessary, because this makes the project more susceptible to breaking whenever a third party library is updated.

Since the Harmony Python package is used by the Harmony API (which is itself used by the R library and the web app), we need to avoid making any changes that break the Harmony API. Please also run the Harmony API unit tests and check that the API still runs with your changes to the Python package: https://github.com/harmonydata/harmonyapi

#### Test Configuration

* Library version:
* OS:
